My name is Matthew Graber and I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at UIUC in Atmospheric Science. I am taking this course to gain a better understanding of weather and climate analysis using open source data. 
My understanding of coding over the years has gotten better but I want to gain a better understanding of how to properly use GitHUB and open source science. Having knowledge in this will be very important
for my career moving forward. When I am not at work, I enjoy being outside, drinking coffee, and playing videogames.
