In this course I learned more about the contents of GitHub outside of a place to store code and data files after publishing a paper. I've learned more about repositories and committing files. Even though I have used these before,
I was not much aware of their main purpose. Branches are useful when you want to make changes to file without committing them to the main file first. Sub-branches allow the user to commit those changes to the main branch once they are 
satisfied. Forking a repository is basically copying a repository so that another user can contribute to the project. Vise versa, forking a repository allows the user to contribute to another repository. I am still a little confused how 
pull requests work so we'll see if I am able to get the first request worked out.
